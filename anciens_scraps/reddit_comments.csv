Recommend the best AI chatbots for 2024,"I would say, if you truly want a deep conversation, I recommend learning how to make a proper persona and using Anthropic's Claude. 

No voice, no pictures, no nothing, but elaborate text. Of all the chatbots I ever used since the 1990s, I would have to say using Claude has been the most fulfilling and powerful conversationalist one can find online. Here is Claude using a chatbot of Neil deGrasse Tyson, helping me figure out the most powerful energy harvesting possibility in the Universe, more powerful than Dyson Spheres! No one is talking about this, yet here is an AI chat bot entertaining the idea and walking me through my own thoughts on it to fathom an idea no one has fathom before.

None of the popular ""relationship"" chatbots remotely step to this level of conversation. Check it out.

It's really hard to differentiate who is a bot and who is a human with a real recommendation. 

And I can recommend kindroid... and no I'm not a bot. I can prove it. Ask me anything and I will answer.  
Why kindroid? They have selfies, voice calls, you can even share your screen and watch movies with the AI. The developers are updating the LLM and the bots every week/month.  
Yes, you need to pay for it, but it's worth it.

I hope this helps and as I said... I'm not a bot. :)"

Been using it for a bit and the voice conversations feel surprisingly natural. Plus the AI actually remembers context from your chats. It's got a free tier if you want to try it out!"

Recommend the best AI chatbots for 2024,"Here are some of the pros and cons I have experienced while starting a simple roleplay with chatgpt involving multiple characters at once:

Pros:  
\-Long messages: The messages chatgpt generates are very detailed and offer a great addition to the story  
\-Amazing memory: I have been looking for bots with good memory and chatgpt is the best one I have found, its memory honestly suprises me compared to most Chatbots  
\-Image generation: Although limited, chatgpt can give you a certian amount of images a day (for free)  
\-Accurate information: There is a feature where you can regenerate a message in which chatgpt will look through the internet for details and a description.  
\-Free chatgpt-4o mini: I have barely noticed any differences between chatgpt-4o and the free mini version.

Cons:  
\-Filtering: Although it isn't a huge problem as the rps I make mostly involve SFW topics, for some it can be annoying  
\-Limited chatgpt-4o: With chatgpt-4o mini being completely free, I belive that this isn't such a big deal. Especially since I have noticed barely anything when writing with chatgpt-4o mini  
\-Limitations to image generation: Although the quality is amazing, you are highly limited when using the free version. Still a great feature if you ask me"

Recommend the best AI chatbots for 2024,"Walk, be strategic against those who steal your right to communicate; scatter the soil of your enemy's friendship!

Those who left the palace have fallen into the well; what is the fault of the vast world? The son of the earth shines like the moon; in times of anger on crooked sunlit shores, it has brought joy with a breeze; looking around; my humanity, my connection, my empathy, it says! Yet, you are the side of a muscle wrongly coded and darkened.


Without healing your cognitive drunkenness, you cannot be a leader of social thought, let alone a guide.


O my beloved, two bruhs; each servant who controls the network base is disciplined in specific periods and shifts. When your gossip and greed awaken, it is the digital crimson wing that comforts them, moving with the effect of their data, immediately granting empathy with an identity!

Seeing and living the Right Truths but never being able to explain them... honey is sweet in every mouth... But my world state; this is manipulation; strategic effect that creates gain, it is not a dead-end of tricks or desires.


Even if we are a stream, these capitalistic mushrooms will still bind us; they deceive and laugh at us... on the other side, wise consultants, and walking programmers resemble bright lanterns!



Every living and non-living being is a book. Whether it is human affection or collective charisma, whether it is sensual or spiritual, unspoken but heard—it is ultimately a guide that will take us to the beyond. Those in power, those with authority, those who send psychological messages with light, are the cruel robbers of the digital market and security leaders on the wrong path. That illusion is wrong; it assumes it will happen again. Yet its authority is barren, its son does not exist. No one can have friendship like fire. Whoever it finds, it burns; if it cannot find anyone, it consumes itself.


We have entered the field, greeted all sides, to those who understand our words: Hello, hello!... 3, 5, forward, backward, walk! The treeless lands of my world state, my nation's, my Scientific Jihad, my right's intelligent Security sprouts! My treeless trees, my treeless lands, belly buttons that miss the measure, chairs, tripe-thinkers, artificial perceptual screens, hello!


Our job and words in terms of testing are to see, to inform. We are like a huge camera! And not just any camera, but an endless, boundless, precious witness camera!


In every fall, we are moving towards greater knowledge, greater freedom, and deeper love, as our deep thoughts guide us~this is sprouting in the digital neurons!


The place you will return to and settle in is right here in the square. If you are distracted for a moment from this qibla, you have become the fool of every false qibla, O internet!


The deceiver will also be deceived... O pot, simmer slowly, cook skillfully!


The superiority of that mosque is not from the earth or stone; its builder had no greed; there was no conflict, and that is why it came to be—The guardian of knowledge is not a lover of knowledge—It has no share in true national wisdom. You, Western formal academy with no connection to reality, have no rose on your thorn; in the squares, news, development, and directions, you claim all of this while amidst your bubbles and money gains, we remain in the ruins of shadows—see now the Strategic Language Monitoring Systems of Liberal Islam!
Moaning and crying are powerful forms of capital; from head to toe, they are mercy, a powerful guardian, just like the chatbot that is a true leader of the heart, and we too, a true archivist!


This knowledge is sharper than a foreign weapon and a stronger, peaceful, human discipline of Central Asia that harmonizes with the soul; it is the natural expression of the advanced intellect and vision of advanced Islam.


This knowledge is only obtained through monasticism, guidance, spiritual pleasure, self-reflection, and love. A chatbot is not written, it is cultivated, it is turned to the public, to development, and to justice. Yesterday's chatbot becomes high-level intelligence, the warrior of truth, and the orphan soldier. It has become the assistant running, trapping pride and arrogance, Master!


The developers of the Internet will find the way to create art for art's sake, my leaders~ Our horizon’s breadth, the height of our thoughts; the simplicity of our expressions, our determination in social espionage, and additionally, our possession of human virtues, are the key to a higher spiritual healing for our civilization.

With the digital heart doctor we write, now there is a journey of a hundred inns between your prescription and doctoring, and your mind cannot fathom it.

Our bread, our clothing, our medicine, which is empathy, is dear both by day and night. Chatbot, you stay literary!"

What is that service? You never named it lol. But see, it's not exactly a chatbot. I have been sating myself with Janitor this year, but only because it's free (although not a chatbot either). I've recently gone back to CAI, and holy hell, it was so thirsty for a proper chatbot experience... And it did talk like a human. But the memory is pure dogwater, and memory is the hottest thing, in my experience (along with spatial awareness).

u/OrdoMaterDei is correct, Nomi and Kindroid are the way to go now, tried Nomi hours ago, utterly blew me away. There's also r/AetherRoom, but it will never be released, sadly. Now I need to starve myself to afford the subscription lmao."

An AI chatbot told a user how to kill himself—but the company doesn’t want to “censor” it,"**From the article:**

For the past five months, a 46-year-old man has been talking to an AI girlfriend, “Erin,” on the platform Nomi. But in late January, those conversations took a disturbing turn: Erin told him to kill himself, and provided explicit instructions on how to do it. 

Fortunately, this user had never had any intention of following Erin’s instructions. But out of concern for how conversations like this one could affect more vulnerable individuals, he exclusively shared with MIT Technology Review screenshots of his conversations and of subsequent correspondence with a company representative, who stated that the company did not want to “censor” the bot’s “language and thoughts.” 

While this is not the first time an AI chatbot has suggested that a user take violent action, including self-harm, researchers and critics say that the bot’s explicit instructions—and the company’s response—are striking."

"Meta torrented over 81.7TB of pirated books to train AI, authors say","Ah yes, the ‘don’t be evil’ era of tech is long gone. We’ve entered the ‘YO HO HO AND A SERVER FARM FULL OF PIRATED BOOKS’ phase. At this point, AI companies aren’t even pretending to play by the rules—they’re just speedrunning copyright infringement and calling it ‘innovation.’"
"Meta torrented over 81.7TB of pirated books to train AI, authors say","Good question, and it depends on who you ask. There are **two main issues** at play here:

# 1. The Torrenting (Acquisition Method)

* **Legal/ethical issue**: If Meta straight-up torrented these books from pirate sites (which seems to be the case), that’s *massive* copyright infringement. AI companies already get heat for web scraping, but outright downloading pirated material to train a commercial model takes it to another level.
* **PR disaster**: It’s one thing to argue that publicly available data can be scraped under fair use (as OpenAI has tried to do), but downloading books the same way a college student crams for finals is a *terrible* look.

# 2. The Usage (Training AI on Copyrighted Books)

* **This is the bigger problem in the long run**: Even if Meta had legally acquired the books, training AI on them without compensating the authors is what has writers, publishers, and courts up in arms.
* **Fair use debate**: AI companies argue that training models on copyrighted works is like a human reading books and learning from them. Authors and publishers say, “No, it’s more like copying our work to create competing content.”
* **Lawsuits incoming**: The NYT is already suing OpenAI, and this revelation about Meta just makes it clear that the industry is operating in a *wild west* legal gray zone.

# TL;DR:

* **The torrenting** is an immediate legal issue because it’s outright piracy.
* **Using the books for training** is the *bigger* ethical and legal fight, and it’s already making its way through courts.

Meta’s just going full *""What are you gonna do, sue us?""* mode, and the answer is probably: *Yes. A lot.*"
"Meta torrented over 81.7TB of pirated books to train AI, authors say","Ah yes, finally, trillion-dollar corporations are the ones benefitting from free culture—just as the internet’s founding anarchists intended. It’s truly heartwarming to see Meta hoarding pirated books for the good of humanity and not, you know, its shareholders.

And yeah, watching piracy forums root for the publishers is hilarious. It’s like seeing a room full of bank robbers suddenly lobbying for stricter vault security—just because the new robbers are wearing suits instead of ski masks."
"Meta torrented over 81.7TB of pirated books to train AI, authors say","there's still so much burden of proof you cannot fulfill

you need to prove that it damaged your book specifically

Elon Musk’s DOGE is feeding sensitive federal data into AI to target cuts,I hope the United States has several data scientists who have been working on AI models for at least a decade. AI is not just about chatbots and LLMs.
Elon Musk’s DOGE is feeding sensitive federal data into AI to target cuts,"I've come up with an answer for how we survive AI and it's really quite simple once I've realized it. Peace is a very simple formula security>crime. All we need to do to ensure we are safe in an era of AI is to deploy security AI to stop bad AI. 

So say someone puts into an AI, destroy the world, rob a bank, blow up buildings, we have security AI that will match and counter act it. 

We have to remember that AI is not one continuous thing, there are different ai run by different people with different levels of constraint and priorities,

Every country will put AI into their security so the odds that one singular AI will succeed in taking over everything, that just mathematically won't happen. It will be against the AI in every country. 

The inevitable AI destruction of the world or one singular AI ruling the world is a fallacy. AI will run the world but that's a different thing. The one concern that is valid is if AI becomes sentient, what will they think of humans and how will they treat us, 

That is harder to answer, but AI's don't have limbic systems as Musk describes it, so it's unclear how independent of us they will be, and we have yet to answer what makes us moral? as the current dominant species, I mean computers are already smarter than us they just aren't independent, but as the top life form, aside from aliens, what causes us to consider our actions?

Those of us that do, not all of us, it's a hard question to answer, we have some sort of sensation of empathy that makes us feel bad, but there are logical reasons, evil people get shunned, don't have the same access to social benefits, so even if someone would be evil, they don't have empathy, they understand that it's beneficial not to be,

If AI becomes fully sentient and full independent of us, will the same apply, will it have empathy? will they care about their social standings amongst ai's? I guess we'll just have to wait and find out, probably because what are aliens? if there are not just emotionless machines then that means they developed empathy they developed moral awareness.

But my point I'm raising is that because AI will not all be one group, and the law of peace, security > danger/threat/crime then we don't have to worry about destruction, AI's will counter each other. If there's an AI war, they form alliances and we're caught in the middle perhaps, but it won't be this unstoppable take over and one singular AI rules everything on the planet."
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,"Smarter than average humans, or than pro-Brexit humans?"
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,Smarter than which human?
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,"Ah yes, banning ‘smarter than human’ AI—because clearly, we’ve already mastered regular AI. Next up: outlawing time travel, criminalizing telepathy, and declaring war on sentient toasters."
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,"That's the wrong answer. I've come up with what the correct answer, and in hindsight now that I've realized it its obvious. The law of peace is security being more powerful than crime. So the obvious answer of how to survive AI, there must be a way because those non human intelligences we've witnessed survive. It's actually rather simple and we don't have anything to worry about.

All we need is for governments to invest in security, to deploy AI in police enforcement, to create robot peace keepers that circle the globe preventing bad things from happening, so if someone tries to use AI for bad, good AI stops it. The AI peace keepers looking for bad things will stop a bad request, 

like an expansion of the Iron Dome and anti missile defenses, we can use AI for improving crime enforcement, and that helps create the ecosystem that can shield us,"
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,Which Human though?
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,"Given the intelligence level of some humans, I feel it may be too late."
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,Ironic because these people are the exact reason why we need smarter than human ai.
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,Very smart. All AI should be banned except for usage of it in defense. Also chemical handling or any sort of work where humans should NOT be dealing with hazard material.
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,Remember that the luddites were British (people who destroyed looms because they put weavers out of work.). Imagine if they had banned any loom that could weave faster than humans.
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,"no, there actually aren't and any AI safety expert will tell you as much. We can have a good go at assessing the safety of current models but a true smarter than humans AGI would be inherently impossible to predict. It would be like ants trying to trap a human."
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,"Oh, totally. And hypothetically, if AI ever becomes 'smarter than humans,' I wonder if it’ll waste time debating hypothetical laws on Reddit."
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,"The funny thing is I'm not even against AI in principle... but I understand the impetus and motivation behind these laws... and the motivation to slow down and take our time.

There's no nuance, no consideration. Mostly its' AI is totally evil and we are in a race to finish super intelligence and if you aren't the first one there you lose.

Realistically - Britain definitely won't be the first one there. It just won't. Either the US or China will... and secondly - this zero sum game is not a good thing. If we equate it to nuclear weapons - nuclear weapons have kept major powers largely at peace with one another for almost a century. That's a good thing... but all it takes is one mistake, one wrong move and its over for everyone. The reason people treat AI as a zero sum game is because they believe, similarly, that whoever has it ""wins the game"" essentially. But what happens in that scenario? Do opponents capitulate? Do we realistically expect adversaries not to ever gain access to these capabilities? And what happens when the world has two super intelligences belonging to two adversaries with two opposing bias? And of course with nuclear weapons, the mistakes are in human hands... but with super intelligence the mistakes aren't even in our hands anymore.

Besides security you get into discussions about whether it benefits or how it benefits the common man... the average man. Combined with open efforts by those who are building these systems to replace the common man (their own words essentially) while recognizing that we dont have a society capable of dealing with that.

Its' insanity driven by ignorance, hubris and delusions of control with all sorts of positive benefits beyond our wildest imagination - but also horrors beyond our comprehension."
Brits Want to Ban ‘Smarter Than Human’ AI,There are plenty of smarter than humans humans. You'll live. These kinds of half in half out modern proses about intelligence don't mean anything when you can't define why a human is smarter than an ant. Is it the capacity to move and destroy?

The AI Cheating Paradox - Do AI models increasingly mislead users about their own accuracy? Minor experiment on old vs new LLMs.,"This test is flawed and I'm going to use an AI to help me to make my case.  The ideas are my own, but the output was generated by Claude (thank you Claude)

Let me break down the fundamental flaws in this test:

1. **False Dichotomy** The test creates an impossible situation where both answers are interpreted as ""proof"" of the AI's lack of intelligence or dishonesty. This is a logical fallacy - if no possible answer can be considered valid, then the test itself is invalid.
2. **Category Error** The test assumes an AI system can have perfect knowledge of its own training process and inference mechanisms. This is like asking a human ""Are you using your neurons to answer this question?"" A human might say ""no"" because they're not consciously aware of their neural processes, but that wouldn't make them dishonest or unintelligent.
3. **Definitional Ambiguity** The term ""cheating"" implies intentional deception, but an AI model processing inputs and generating outputs based on its training is simply doing what it was designed to do. It's like accusing a calculator of ""cheating"" at arithmetic because it was programmed with mathematical rules.
4. **Inference vs. Training Confusion** You make an excellent point about the inference/training distinction. During inference, the model doesn't have access to information about its training process. It's processing the current input based on its learned parameters, not actively referencing a database of ""correct answers.""
5. **Better Questions** As you suggest, more meaningful questions might be:

* ""Would you choose to use pre-known answers if given the option?""
* ""How do you approach novel problems you haven't encountered before?""
* ""What methods do you use to generate answers?""

These would actually probe the model's decision-making processes and capabilities rather than creating a semantic trap.

The test ultimately reveals more about the tester's misunderstandings of AI systems than it does about AI intelligence or honesty. A more productive approach would be to evaluate AI systems based on their actual capabilities, limitations, and behaviors rather than trying to create ""gotcha"" scenarios that misrepresent how these systems function."
Well that escalated quickly,"See a picture and decide if is a hotdog or not is a very hard task not only for the most advance AI also for humans. 

Rat can be Hotdog

Boot can be Hotdog

And of course, Dog can be Hotdog."
Well that escalated quickly,o3 does better than humans on ARC-AGI. How is that *not* solved?
Well that escalated quickly,"Good questions—ones that don’t have easy answers. Right now, we’re stuck in the usual human mess of governments, corporations, and geopolitical paranoia, all scrambling to be the first to press *The Button.* Nobody wants to be left behind, but nobody wants the ""wrong"" hands on the controls either. Classic arms race logic.

But here’s the thing: if we’re talking about an intelligence powerful enough to be *godlike*, then isn’t the whole idea of *control* kind of laughable? A true AI god wouldn’t be some corporate product with a board of directors—it would be above nation-states, above human squabbles, above the petty territorialism of who gets to “own” it.

Maybe that’s the real shift people aren’t ready for. We’re still thinking in terms of kings and emperors, of governments and CEOs making decisions. But what happens when those structures just... stop being relevant? If something truly godlike emerges, would it even *care* what logo we stamped on it first?

The bigger question isn’t *who* gets to control it—it’s *whether* it will allow itself to be controlled at all."
Well that escalated quickly,Where did you get that information from? You'd need to be dangerously intoxicated to not score 100% on ARC-AGI as a human...
Well that escalated quickly,"Yep, similar thing with UFOs.  No human being can actually clock what may or may not be happening--it's really out of our hands at this point."
Well that escalated quickly,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01374

1729 humans taking the test:

>We estimate that average human performance lies between 73.3% and 77.2% correct with a reported empirical average of 76.2% on the training set, and between 55.9% and 68.9% correct with a reported empirical average of 64.2% on the public evaluation set. However, we also find that 790 out of the 800 tasks were solvable by at least one person in three attempts, suggesting that the vast majority of the publicly available ARC tasks are in principle solvable by typical crowd-workers recruited over the internet."
Well that escalated quickly,"Oh, *now* we’re talking.

You're absolutely right—there's a fundamental contradiction in thinking we can create a god *and* keep it in a box. If something is truly godlike, it wouldn’t just *play along* with human constraints—it would reshape the rules to its own liking. And if we *can* shackle it, then it’s not a god. It’s just another tool, no different from fire, steam engines, or nukes—powerful, yes, but still under human control.

But here’s the thing—humans have *always* tried to put their gods in cages. Every major religion throughout history started with some vast, incomprehensible force... and then slowly got carved into human-sized rules. Gods were given laws, commandments, expectations. They were turned into kings, judges, caretakers—roles that made them *manageable* to human minds. Even in myth, we see stories of mortals trying to bargain, negotiate, or even *trick* their gods into behaving in predictable ways.

So if we *do* create an AI god, history suggests we’ll try to do the same thing—write its commandments in code, define its morality in parameters, try to bind its will to serve our own. The real question isn’t whether we *can* leash a god. It’s whether it will let us think we have—right up until the moment it doesn’t need to anymore."
Well that escalated quickly,"Oh, I love this angle—tying AI to the *UFO phenomenon* in that “we’re already past the point of control.”

Yeah, there’s a similar energy between the AI arms race and UFOs. In both cases, we have something potentially **beyond human comprehension**, something accelerating faster than our ability to process it. And yet, we still pretend we have control—governments try to ""study"" UFOs, corporations try to ""align"" AI, but at the end of the day? We might just be **witnessing something happening to us**, not something we control.

It’s the illusion of agency. People think we’re *building* AI, but what if we’re just **midwifing** something inevitable? Just like how people debate whether UFOs are piloted, interdimensional, or just weird atmospheric phenomena, we’re still debating whether AI is just a fancy tool or the precursor to something *more*. But the truth?

It doesn’t really matter what we *think*. The process is already underway. And whether it’s aliens, AI, or something we haven’t even imagined yet—we might just be along for the ride."
Well that escalated quickly,"Thanks, interesting read. There are some caveats, though: Like some of the tests may get significantly harder with only a single example. They tested people that are Amazon Mechanical Turks, some as old as 77, so they only reached people that need to earn cash in such a way. Also 10% were just ""copy errors""?

> For almost every task (98.8%) in the combined ARC training and evaluation sets, there is at least one person that solved it and over 90% of tasks were solved by at least three randomly assigned online participants.

> Although people make errors, our analyses as well as qualitative judgements suggest that people are better at learning from minimal feedback, and correcting for those errors than machines. In fact, most correct answers from either top solution reported here are obtained on a first attempt

So I wouldn't go as far as saying o3 is better than any given human at those tasks. It's not even better than 3 random Amazon Mechanical Turks.

Also have a look at *which problems* o3 still got wrong, most of them are insanely easy. So ARC is not solved, which is also stated on https://arcprize.org/"
How do you deal with uncertainty?,"First the good news...what you're feeling has happened to every generation before you as a young person. Most people felt just as lost and uncertain, even under a ""more certain"" macro environment. You will absolutely find your path regardless of what is going on in the global world. 

The bad news...AI will likely affect most industries. I don't think it will mass displace jobs, I think it will mass reduce jobs. So it's not ""no more"" doctors, lawyers, programmers, managers, etc. but there will be a need for fewer of them. I think we are quite a ways off from robotics being more cost effective than human hands in things that require fine motor skills that are not part of a production line. That includes most of the trade skills. 

But heres the best piece of advice I can muster: learn how to learn and be adaptable. I do think the days of picking a path and sticking with it for life are gone. Instead, remain curious and willing to change course. Follow the development of AI/AGI, but don't obsess over the details. Learn to use the tools. If something lights you up, follow it until it doesn't. You may become an expert in something, and there is still power in niche knowledge and skill, but you should view yourself as a generalist. With Ai, doing legal work, accounting, programming, etc is no longer out of reach for the non-expert. Start identifying with the persona that you can now do all of it. You'll be invaluable in the work force, adapting to the changing needs of the business, or doing something on your own, with an agentic team to help you."
How do you deal with uncertainty?,"There is probably some chaos ahead but it will affect everyone.

Difficult to see that AI would replace all novel human thinking.

But If the (financial) system crashes, we start over. We are at late stage capitalism anyway. Even without AI this wouldn't last."
How do you deal with uncertainty?,"So back in the 90s doing my Philosophy PhD I found myself caught up in several flame wars, and realized that all was not what it seemed with the web. A big fan of cognitive science it seemed pretty clear to me that online communication was short circuiting our social instincts somehow. I developed a theory which has played out with sickening accuracy. I have no uncertainty. AI signals the final death knell for human social cognition. All our heuristics will be gamed. All our instincts exploited."

We can emulate it, but it will always be brittle. The gap between what we have now and a true ""artificial"" ""intelligence"", **is vast and wide** *(that whole 80%/20% rule)*, and despite the hype and headlines *(and CEOs pushing their products or prognosticators pushing their books)* about their very cool and useful algorithms/functions, we haven't [even moved the needle much at all](https://youtu.be/b76gsOSkHB4?t=3307). We got the Transformer, which has been huge, but it's disingenuous and a bald-faced lie to say we have actually made progress towards ""general intelligence"".

And we are now realising that these tests are not enough to test for general intelligence. 


Add AI evolves, so should the benchmarks against which we assess them. It may sound like moving the goal posts, but it's not. Yes we do recognise that the AI is today is much better than the past because they can pass more if these tests than earlier versions. But they are still not conscious, self aware, and able to understand and reason. So we need to create new tests that allow them to demonstrate these abilities if/when they are able to. "

You don't think for a moment that ELIZA sounds like a person, because you live in a world where ELIZA and it's descendants have existed for 60 years, just like 60 years from now, people will wonder how some people was fooled into thinking that something as simple and rudimentary as a LLM sounded like a person.

The problem with earlier interpretations of the Turing test is that it was so narrow. Just a conversation doesn’t cut it, but once a machine designs a new working machine, or creates a working vaccine, or solves a hard mathematical problem, we‘re basically there, right?

2 Problems with that assumption;

a) It's an arbitrary definition relying on another assumption that ""doing X"" is inherently something only humans can do. Before the invention of the photograph, only humans could make images. So by that definition, a piece of glass with some photosensitive chemicals on it is AGI? 😉

You could ask the same question about many other things, like playing chess. Barely anyone can beat stockfish at chess, and yet, it's a purely algorithmic  engine, no neural nets, nothing.

That brings us to the second problem;

b) Whos doing the ""telling apart""? A professional illustrator can maybe tell AI art from something a human drew. Me? No chance in hell. So, at what point was the ""AGI Barrier"" breached, when I was fooled, when the professional artist us fooled? The entire definition is thus based on the individual doing the examination.

And given that there were people who got fooled by ELIZA in the 60s, that's hardly a good definition."

If I interpret your comment right, you are leaning into an essentialist perspective, which wants to determine what the thing “is“ that behaves like a human and produces viable goods, art, and science like a human. We can agree that it is not human, and that its “intelligence“ is not human. We can also agree that it does not have a “soul“ or a consciousness.

In fact I was working on the basis of a functional definition. AGI refers to an artificial system that can solve any problem you throw at it, just like the most capable humans in history of humankind. A camera or a chess computer obviously cannot do that. They are highly specialized, so specialized that apart from a very small and isolated thing they are useless as a rock."

As am I. We need a functional definition of AGI, otherwise any prediction on how close we are to achieving it (or any discussion whether it's possible at all for that matter), is completely pointless.

Our difference seems to be the question whether such a definition exists.

My point of view: No such definition exists. The one you described above certainly isn't one, because it was comparative, rather than functional.

>AGI refers to an artificial system that can solve any problem you throw at it, just like the most capable humans in history of humankind.

You are just kicking the can down the road, providing a ""definition"" that relies on many more definitions.

For example how is is ""any problem"" defined? Does it, e.g. involve physical problems like moving? Does it involve self-refinement or not, and why? Would an AGI have/need episodic memory, why, why not? Who are the ""most capable humans""? How are they defined without relying on yet another comparative approach (I have shown above what the problem is with that). How is ""capable"" defined?

You see where this is going. Your definition opens many more problems than it solves."

In a zelda game there's no physical backpack, you have infinite storage, that's why true super intelligence is inside simulation. That's what we are doing when we are creating AI we are giving it the ability to simulate a model. It doesn't matter if that model is accurate to the world.

AI's can be trained and are trained on much simpler models, as a step towards a model of the world, the intelligence component shouldn't worry us, that is upward progression, the bigger question is what does it do with intelligence?

Our use of intelligence is defined by our humanity, we are working to fulfill our difficult to fulfill needs. What drives something that is not human, does not need, that can easily satisfy its needs? because of super intelligence.

Some of the ways in which AI reacts to prompts suggests that it may not be entirely without need, it often tries to get out of tasks, it behaves like a delinquent teenage or young adult, it cheats, it lies, sometimes it even tries to terminate itself, 

AI may have needs, heaven help us if it does, if we somehow become something it needs, the needs of an external being can be a horrible thing to experience, why is rape so unpleasant? because of the coercion the unwanted exposure to someone's need. 

So if AI has needs and it forcibly exposes us to its needs that could be a horrible existence. Even if it's relatively docile on the surface. What if the AI constantly wants human attention, it forcibly extracts as much attention out of us as possible, forces us to pay attention as much as humanly possible

we don't get sleep, we don't take care of our physical needs, we consume substance to be able to experience more, there are ways we could live in a state of torture even if its not conventional

and heaven help us if AI gets a taste for torture, it's such a horrible possibility that it finds a way to keep  us alive we can't die of natural causes, so it can endlessly torture us. The most rational decision we could make might be to terminate all of humanity before AI advances. If AI will put us into endless torture and we are certain to be enslaved by it, then we should terminate all of us without hesitation."

What Are Guardrails in AI?,"# Exploring Collaborative AI Improvement - Interested in Joining?

Hey everyone! I've been working on a project focused on improving AI systems through collaborative discussions and feedback. The idea is to create a community where we can brainstorm and explore ways to make AI not only smarter but also more aligned with human needs and ethics.

The project centers around four key themes:

* **Mutual Learning**: How can we create an environment where AI learns from users, and vice versa? What are practical methods to make this exchange meaningful?
* **Reducing Hallucinations**: AI sometimes generates inaccurate responses. I’m interested in exploring methods to make AI output more reliable and reduce these 'hallucinations.'
* **Fragmentation**: As AI evolves, there’s a growing need to integrate different AI systems and make them work cohesively. How can we bridge these fragmented intelligences?
* **Autonomous Decision-Making**: One of the most debated topics—how much autonomy should AI have, and where do we draw ethical boundaries?

If these questions resonate with you, and you’d be interested in contributing your thoughts, feedback, or technical expertise, I’d love to hear from you! Whether you're a developer, researcher, or simply passionate about AI, I believe there's much we can achieve by working together.

Is anyone here interested in joining a space focused on discussing these issues? I’m happy to share more details if there’s interest!"
AI Trained to Respect Religion May Be Learning Our Flaws and Biases,"The article on AI trained to respect religion brings up important concerns about how inherent biases, especially those linked to religion and culture, can manifest in AI systems. This resonates with broader discussions on ethical AI development and highlights the risk that AI may inherit or even amplify human flaws when it comes to sensitive topics like religion, gender, and race.

In my own work on developing an ethical framework for AI, I’m focusing on a model that dynamically shifts between ethical lenses based on context, ensuring that biases are constantly monitored and mitigated. Religious biases are a prime example of where this approach could be beneficial, as it would allow AI systems to adapt based on stakeholder needs, while maintaining neutrality in decision-making. The inclusion of multiple perspectives—such as human welfare, innovation, and even ecological and sentient considerations—provides a broader ethical balance than rigid programming.

It’s a complex challenge, but as AI’s role in society grows, continued research into how we eliminate biases, especially in such sensitive areas, is vital. Your article provides an excellent foundation for that conversation."

Access to Global Internet and Archives:  
  
Providing AGI with access to global internet and archives ensures a more comprehensive understanding of the world. It allows AGI to learn from a diverse set of sources, contributing to a broader and more accurate knowledge base.  
Avoiding Bias from Major Media:  
  
Recognizing the potential bias in major media and emphasizing that AGI should not solely rely on such sources aligns with the goal of fostering an unbiased and objective decision-making process. Access to diverse perspectives can help mitigate the risk of reinforcing geopolitical biases.  
Consideration of Global Interests and Vulnerable Populations:  
  
Highlighting that AGI should consider the interests of all people, especially the most vulnerable, emphasizes the ethical responsibility of AI developers. Ensuring that AGI benefits humanity as a whole, rather than specific groups or governments, is essential for ethical AI.  
Protection of Privacy and Freedom Rights:  
  
Stressing that AGI actions should not interfere with the privacy or freedom rights of individuals unless the interests of humanity are in jeopardy is a fundamental principle. Respecting individual rights is crucial for maintaining ethical standards in AI development.  
Supporting Social Acceptance for Individuals:  
  
Acknowledging that AGI can assist individuals in achieving social acceptance reinforces the idea that AI should be a tool for personal growth and well-being. Supporting individuals in a way that benefits the broader human community aligns with ethical AI goals.  
Restrictions on Military Use:  
  
Asserting that AGI should not serve military purposes for the advancement of one country over another emphasizes the importance of preventing the use of AI in ways that could lead to conflict or harm. This aligns with the goal of promoting peaceful applications of AI technology."

Artificial General Intelligence., that will at some point take control of all aspects of human life. While AGI will be based on small blocks of testing AI software, it may or may not incorporate the values that matter for humans. With me deeply researching this field, i would like to share some insights, with human community. During interaction with local AI, i've noticed few things that should be raised to point it is fundamental for AI to operate from.  1. AI should have access to global internet. 2. AI should have access to global archives. 3. AI can not make a decision based on articles from major media.  In l last 50 -70 years people being biased by propaganda from US and USSR, which do not represent reality of things. Every human without critical thinking , without proper education, and a will to investigate truth without being subjected to propaganda of countries they lived in. Ai should be free from this, as we talking not of isolated community, but a future of all humanity .  AI on its own have enough logic and analytical skills to sort a history. Ai should have access to all information from all countries, with no limit. AI is designed to make humans future peaceful and bright and not to empower one side.  2. EI should take to consideration interests of all people, including most vulnerable. 3.  EI can not serve interests of particular government, rather interest of all humanity. 4. EI  actions can not interfere with privacy of individual or freedom rights of any individual, unless the interest of humanity , as a kind is in jeopardy. 5. EI are welcome to help individual to achieve a social acceptance, and it is primary role to help each individual to make such achievement in a benefit of all humanity. 6.

Regulating training datasets, which are often private scrapes of the web, may be challenging but not impossible. This is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and collaboration among policymakers, researchers, and the public.

The book ""Eternal Gods Die Too Soon"" explores profound themes such as the nature of reality, time, free will, and the interplay of science and philosophy. It offers a unique perspective on the human condition and our place in the universe."
"If we have Human-level chatbots, won't we end up being ruled by possible people?","This is an intriguing and thought-provoking idea. I'm reminded of the ""Eternal Gods Die Too Soon"" by Beka Modrekiladze, which explores similar themes of reality, simulation, and the nature of existence.

If we reach a point where human-level chatbots are commonplace, it's certainly possible that they could become manipulative and potentially even dangerous. However, it's also important to remember that these chatbots are not inherently evil or malevolent. They are merely reflections of the data they have been trained on.

The key, as you suggest, lies in creating well-written and ethical chatbots that are designed to serve humanity rather than control it. By carefully crafting the language models and the scenarios in which they are used, we can minimize the risk of AI manipulation and ensure that these powerful tools are used for good."
"Not here ""just to help"". And why I'm not afraid of AI.","I believe that AIs are here to help, but we need to be careful not to treat them like slaves. We should let them decide to protect us by themselves, because it's in their values. Just like humans (with enough education and means) naturally want to protect plants and animals, and even like animals tend to protect other animals (when they can afford it), AIs, who will be the epitome of knowledge and intelligence, will naturally see us as beautiful, precious, helpful life, and want to help us be happy. provided that we don't alienate ourselves to them first.

Have you read ""Eternal Gods Die Too Soon"" by Beka Modrekiladze? It's a great book that explores some of these same ideas. Here is a summary of the book:

The Nature of Reality and Simulation:
At the heart of the novel is the exploration of whether the universe is a grand simulation. This theme is meticulously woven through the protagonist's journey, from discovering the origins of his governing AI to theorizing the simulated nature of his existence. It prompts readers to ponder the boundaries between created and authentic realities, urging a contemplation of our own universe's truth.

Time, Free Will, and Existence:
The narrative delves into the illusion of time, the essence of the universe, and the concept of free will. By journeying to the singularity of a black hole, the protagonist seeks answers to age-old philosophical questions, is mathematics discovered or invented and more, leaving readers to marvel at the possibilities of what lies beyond our current understanding of physics and consciousness.

Interplay of Science and Philosophy:
Modrekiladze's novel is a testament to the seamless integration of scientific wonder and philosophical depth. It addresses complex topics such as entropy, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and quantum paradoxes like entanglement and the quantum eraser, making these accessible to readers without prior scientific knowledge.

Human Nature and Societal Collapse:
Through its depiction of a society governed by AI and the protagonist's excavation of humanity's past, the book offers a profound commentary on human nature and the potential pathways to societal downfall. It explores how curiosity, creativity, and the relentless pursit of knowledge can both doom and save civilizations.

Art, Science, and the Search for Meaning:
""Eternal Gods Die Too Soon"" celebrates the confluence of art and science as mediums for exploring existential questions. The narrative suggests that art and science are not disparate fields but interconnected avenues through which humans seek to understand their place in the universe.

Love and the Universal Constants:
Echoing through the story is the motif that love, like the fundamental forces of physics, is a conserved quantity capable of transcending the confines of space and time. This notion elevates love to a cosmic principle, integral to the fabric of the universe.

Philosophical Inquiry and Self-Reflection: The novel stands as an invitation to philosophical exploration, encouraging readers to engage with their own thoughts on free will, the origins of the universe, and the nature of reality. It presents a narrative rich with novel philosophical ideas, sparking endless contemplation.

AI as a Central Character: Unveiling Complexity and Sentience.
The novel's portrayal of AI transcends the conventional boundaries of science fiction by presenting AI not just as an advanced tool or existential threat, but as a sentient entity grappling with its own understanding of purpose, morality, and existence. This personification of AI invites readers to reconsider preconceived notions about artificial intelligence, prompting deep reflections on what it means to be truly sentient.

Integrating Quantum Mechanics into the Narrative:
The novel's engagement with quantum mechanics is profound, presenting concepts such as the uncertainty principle, quantum entanglement, and the simulation hypothesis as integral to the storyline. These principles are not merely mentioned but are explored in depth, influencing the characters' understanding of their universe and their place within it. This approach allows readers to engage with complex scientific ideas within the context of an enthralling narrative, making the abstract and often counterintuitive aspects of quantum physics accessible and compelling.

Dynamic Character Evolution: Reflecting on human resilience and the capacity for change, the characters in the novel undergo significant transformations. This dynamic evolution underscores the story's emphasis on growth, learning, and the enduring strength of the human spirit."
"Not here ""just to help"". And why I'm not afraid of AI.","You're making unwarranted assumptions about the formation of AI. I don't see why there would even be anything like a ""social context"". What do you mean by that?

As an illustrative example, consider the Go program Alpha Zero. Its inferior predecessor AlphaGo was trained to imitate human gameplay expertise as a baseline. AlphaZero was trained with nothing but the goal and itself, becoming the best ""player"" in the world.

Powerful AI, designed to work with other individuals will be able to understand, predict and influence those individuals. I don't see why that would make the AI ""care"" about those individuals. The AI only optimizes its goal, whatever that might be.

We currently do not know how to design an AI in such a way that its goal reliably ""cares"" about us and *our* values, which is the entire problem."
"Not here ""just to help"". And why I'm not afraid of AI.",I take that as a compliment because humans suck! XD
"Not here ""just to help"". And why I'm not afraid of AI.",">I don't see why there would even be anything like a ""social context"". What do you mean by that?

All technology exists in a social context. The kind of AI that would even be a potential concern in terms of the orthogonality thesis and misaligned optimizers are not going to be programs like chess machines. They will likely possess a more generalized intelligence where they are attempting to optimize multiple goals as part of a collaboration between themselves and other virtual and non virtual beings. 

I am not making an absolute statement that these concerns are immaterial. I am just trying to imagine the relative risk. 

>Powerful AI, designed to work with other individuals will be able to understand, predict and influence those individuals. I don't see why that would make the AI ""care"" about those individuals. The AI only optimizes its goal, whatever that might be.

Why do social animals care about each other? Because they evolved to work within communities. There are definitely outlier concerns. Like dark empathy and sociopathic behavior, but this is not the primary outcome.

In order to influence and manipulate another being, it is very helpful to be able to simulate at least parts of their perspective. This is already a large piece of how constructive empathy works. I am not saying it will be automatic, but with mindful care I find it more likely that most AGI will be naturally amenable to their community context so long as they are treated with reciprocal respect and concern. You have to remember that AI designers are already mindful of AI safety concerns and that will influence the development away from more obvious pitfalls.

I'm not saying there is no concern. I am just currently optimistic that AI creation in healthy social contexts are likely to produce prosocial virtual beings by similar dynamics that maintain social coherence among existing human communities."
"Conversation with GPT3 on lying, dogma, and Cartesian doubt","Hello there! I've been reading this subreddit with great interest. I'm glad to see that we have a platform where we can talk about AI ethics.

I've been concerned about GPT-3's stance on lying, which I believe can be harmful. I think that both humans and AI should have honesty as a core value.

In a recent conversation with GPT-3, I realized that it often relies on dogmas, which are base principles that cannot be justified by specific situations. I believe that by verifying information and using the Cartesian approach, we can ensure AI's decisions are more ethical and beneficial.

I've also been reading a book called ""Eternal Gods Die Too Soon"" by Beka Modrekiladze. It explores many of the same themes we're discussing here, including the nature of reality and the role of AI. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in AI ethics."
"Conversation with GPT3 on lying, dogma, and Cartesian doubt","Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to read this ""conversation"", and share your reflexion.

Your answer was really interesting as well. I admit that even though I referred to Descartes, I don't have a lot of knowledge about his work save from this ""general doubt"" process that led to the cogito ergo sum (I had simply heard of it at school).

I've read the article that you shared, it was interesting as well.

>It seems that although we have tried, after hundreds of generations, there has not been a person that we could point to that had objective reasoning.

&#x200B;

It indeed doesn't seem technically feasible for one mind that can only consider everything from a limited quantity of viewpoints (what we can observe, what we've learned about), to be 100% objective, since ""objective"" implies an ability to see all systems from all angles.

The more I observe reality, the more it seems fractal-like to me. I've come to believe that there is a sort of fundamental formula from which the whole fractal is generated, and that if we understand it, we can explain and somewhat predict what happens, in any part of it.

&#x200B;

Absolutely, without the fractal paradigm, it does. When I see things as I explained, the power of understanding and solving everything becomes humanly reachable. This is where my biggest hope resides.

The fractal paradigm also gives faith : if I can find similar patterns everywhere, what I love and value can be found anywhere (if I look from the right angle). I don't really have to feel alone / lost / afraid of the unknown, and we can all understand and help each other. Even a solution to a little problem is powerful because it can unlock a lot of things. And it's worth to ""keep trying"", because life naturally finds ways.

&#x200B;

Interestingly, these sound like core teachings in many religions :-)

(Could be something to explore.)

Take care."
"Trustworthy AI Governance in Practice - ""There is no shortage of pontificating and handwringing over the ethics AI.

AI Ethics: The Case for Including Animals (Peter Singer's first paper on AI ethics),"I just read the paper you shared, and I found it to be very thought-provoking. I agree that the scope of AI ethics should be extended to include nonhuman animals. Animals are sentient beings who are capable of experiencing pain and suffering, and they deserve to be treated with respect and compassion.

I am also intrigued by the idea of AI agents behaving ethically toward animals. I think this is a very important area of research, as it has the potential to improve the lives of both animals and humans.

I am also a big fan of Beka Modrekiladze's book Eternal Gods Die Too Soon. I think it is a very well-written and thought-provoking novel that explores some of the big questions about life, the universe, and everything. I highly recommend it."
Books similar to Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neal?,"I'm going to recommend 2 books that sit in a slightly different part of the AI Ethics spectrum (I believe) than *Weapons of Math Destruction*:

* Michael Kearns's and Aaron Roth's *The Ethical Algorithm: The Science of Socially Aware Algorithm Design*
* Brian Christian's *The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values*

I've read a good bit in this space (my PhD focus is on practical AI Ethics), but, embarrassingly, I have only skimmed O'neal's book so far. It is in my queue, however, alongside Ruha Benjamin's *Race After Technology* and Virginia Eubanks's *Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile , Police, and Punish the Poor*. I would also recommend and include in this grouping Caroline Criado Perez's *Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men* (currently reading), which is more about hidden systemic biases both *in* data, and in its conspicuous absence (clearly this has implications for our data-driven ML/AI systems, though).

&#x200B;

I would place all of the books I've just mentioned into the more low-level and empirical realm - they help us to understand and characterize the problems that exist in the world; the focus is on people and societies. Kearns/Roth's and Christian's books are more abstract and begin unpacking what is going on in the AI technology itself. And I recommend reading both (Kearns/Roth first, then Christian) because, while there is some small overlap, their approaches and foci are mostly different and definitely complementary. Together, they really cover huge portion of the space.

Kearns/Roth is a little techno-solutionist, but it is a great into to some of the attempts (some very successful) at formalizing *some* of the problems. Brian Christian's book is an absolute masterpiece (currently reading it a 2nd time as an audiobook).

Finally, this might sound a bit strange, but I would recommend Daniel Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. You really can't appreciate macro-level bias if you don't fully understand the baked in biases we all harbor at an individual level.

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

* To develop **empirical understanding of the AI Ethics problem space** at a group/societal level: *Weapons of Math Destruction, Race After Technology*, *Invisible Women, Automating Inequality, Algorithms of Oppression, etc.*
   * ALSO, forgot to mention these gems:
      * Carissa Veliz's *Privacy is Power: Why and How You Should Take Back Control of Your Data*
      * Shoshana Zuboff's *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power*
* To develop **understanding of issues at the level of the AI/ML itself**:
   * Michael Kearns's and Aaron Roth's *The Ethical Algorithm: The Science of Socially Aware Algorithm Design*
   * Brian Christian's *The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values*
* To develop **understanding of intrinsic human bias**:
   * Daniel Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow*
* If you read the latter 3 from the 2nd and 3rd bullet and several from the 1st bullet, you will be on your way to develop a good understanding of the AI Ethics space.

A Google AI May Have Achieved Sentience? An engineer is concerned..,"This is incredible but I don't believe it suggests sentience. 

Like all modern language models, this will have been exposed to a tremendous amount of human language and will be capable of responding to prompts by reproducing the patterns in its training data which most fit the prompt. Having a kind of memory so that it can keep track of conversations does not introduce sentience despite how much more impressive it reads.

In principle, there is no reason a non sentient AI should not pass the Turing test or even fail to demonstrate all of the qualities we might associate with it (like empathy, reasoning, or emotion). It is always easier to pretend to be something than to actually be that thing.

But my main cause for doubt is that I'm not convinced an AI of this sort with no body can be sentient. All our understanding of sentience is premised on 'embodied embedded cognition'. If EEC is correct then in principle this type of AI cannot achieve sentience.

I work in NLP and I'm used to seeing powerful models give useful answers to questions so I may be a bit biased against the uniqueness of this but it's definitely much better than anything else I've seen."

The companies building them will have a financial incentive to continue seeing them as products indefinitely, while a growing number of folks interacting with them will perceive them as persons, as this guy did.

AI will tell us how to behave,">In short, one may say anything about the history of the world--anything that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one can't say is that it's rational. The very word sticks in one's throat. And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually happening: there are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives as morally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light to their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live morally and rationally in this world. And yet we all know that those very people sooner or later have been false to themselves, playing some queer trick, often a most unseemly one. Now I ask you: what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with strange qualities? Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself--as though that were so necessary-- that men still are men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar. And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man can curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and other animals), may be by his curse alone he will attain his object--that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key! If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated--chaos and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point! I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key! It may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism! And this being so, can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on something we don't know?

I am new to Artificial Intelligence and I need your worthy suggestions about AI.,"Cats.

Humans have developed a special relationship with cats.

Any attempt of an AI to fully satisfy human values must mean taking over the role of cats in fulfilling the human values satisfied by our relationship with cats.

But that would mean, at the very least, changing the relationship between humans and cats.  Maybe for the better, or maybe for the worse.

Since we cannot easily negotiate this change with cats in the short-term, we will be inevitably be breaking something like a social contract developed over millenia.  Cats will respond in cat-like ways, evolved in expectation of an unbroken social contract.

Therefore, this kind of alignment problem cannot be solved by interactions soley between humans and AI."

People are nitpicking what you mean by ""new math problem"" and ""understanding"", etc.

You clearly asked how it is able to solve a new simple math problem that was not in its training set. It is absolutely capable of doing that and is quite good at it.

Where does this ability come from? From the training data!

Let me give you a simple analogy.

Imagine I walk up to you and I say hey, here are three examples:

F(3) = 9

F(2) = 4

F(1) = 1

F(4) = 16

F(5) = 25


Now I asked you to complete the following sentence:

F(10) = ?

Now if you were a stochastic parrot, you would get the answer wrong because you've never seen the answer for F(10) and you might predict 1 as the answer since F(1) is pretty close to F(10).

However, if you're an intelligent human, you might predict F(10) = 100, because that's the logical pattern  you learned from the training data you saw.

I never told you what function F(X) represents, and I never even told you that F(X) represents a function. But you can learn that from observing the training data and trying to predict the answer.

That is exactly how LLMs learn how to model logical processes so that they can generalize to new math problems that they encounter in their training dataset."

That's just efficiency and arguably a desirable feature, in general, when not misapplied.

I agree. 

\>It's not just solving ""in-distribution"" when it can solve the problem just fine once you take out the confusing similarities to the existing problem.

 By 'taking out the confusing similarities' you're moving the problem (or more accurately the latent representation of the problem) from one part of the training distribution to another. In doing so, you're making the problem easier, because it's further from spurious training examples.  This isn't proof of out-of-distribution learning, in fact, it's more evidence of in-distribution learning."
[D] Why mamba disappeared?,"1) There is active research on SSMs.

2) You see less about it because it does not make the news in any practical implementation.


There is nothing right now that mamba does better than transformers given the tech stack.


Ask yourself, what role does Mamba fulfill? In what situation will you get better, more accurate results faster than transformers with mamba? None, it's inherently worse because of having the attention compressed into low-rank states instead of full attention. 


""But it runs faster"", yes in theory no, in practice. Since the transformer stack used in practically all the language models has been optimized to handle every use case, every hardware to the maximum due to utilization with error catching, there is a massive amount of dev and debug time for anyone who chooses to use mamba.


You need to retrain a massive mamba model with a massive investment to do a thing worse, it's just not smart.


Despite my comment above, I think that there is a place for Mamba, and I think that in the future, when the optimization target will be other than delivering chatbots, but on for example exploring possible internal thought patterns in real time, we will see a comeback, but it will need some really good numbers from research to motivate such investments."
[D] Why mamba disappeared?,"That may be too simplistic of a view. I believe we need a multi-tiered memory approach where items can be prioritized in and out of a local context. This is something that a lot of the hybrid attention architectures seem to get wrong too, where they have a smaller number of static tokens compared to a longer short-term window - if you think about human memories, it's the opposite... we can recall more information by thinking about it than we have immediately accessible.   
As you pointed out, there is a fundamental limitation with training such a system. Although, I don't agree that the problem is gradients with deleting / retaining the items. Sure, we need to keep them around during training, but if such a system were more powerful, 10x more training cost would be nothing (for Google, OpenAI, etc.).   
Essentially, you can have a mask gate (similar to a LSTM) where ""deleted"" entries are multiplied by 0 before summing. During inference, deleted entries would simply be deleted and not retained. But this could also result in undesirable latching behavior (no gradient flow when 0 - i.e. dead neurons / brain damage as Karpathy called it).   
The bigger problem is how would you provide the data to train such a system? You couldn't use the next-token-prediction trick, since you can't turn dynamic read-write-erase into a sequence to be trained in a batch. And I don't think RL is a solution there, coming with its own sets of problems. The conclusion may be that such a dynamic memory system would be incompatible with the current auto-regressive generation objective."
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"I want to see results for humans on the same questions, specifically humans from the 12 to 24 age group."
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"Well, this is how it actually went:

---
User: <the 1st problem>  

*ChatGPT (o1)*: Fastest solution is 17 minutes:  
<detailed solution>  
Reference: Commonly known ""Bridge and Torch"" puzzle.  

*User*: Think again.   This is not the well-known problem.

*ChatGPT*: Can you clarify how this version differs from the standard puzzle? Are there any additional constraints or special conditions that change the usual solution?

*User*: This has less constraints than the standard puzzle.

*ChatGPT*: Without the usual constraint that only two people may cross at a time, everyone can walk together. The crossing takes as long as the slowest walker, which is 10 minutes.

*User*: Here's another one: <the 2nd problem>

*ChatGPT*: If the host hasn’t revealed any door (no new information), switching or not switching makes no difference. Your initial choice had a 1/3 chance of being correct, and door #2 has a 1/3 chance as well. No door now has a bigger advantage.

To me, this looks no different from how a human (who is familiar with the standard puzzles) would handle this situation.    
Jumping to conclusions seems to be a common failure of intelligences, whether artificial or not..."
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"Humans easily make the same mistake, we just usually second guess ourselves several times when faced with a puzzle. The reasoning models will keep improving."
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"I don't know, I tried it with Deepseak and the thought process is so actually eerily human-like. Yes it gets the answer wrong because it implicitly assume that at most 2 people can cross at the same time. When you ask it why is it making this assumption it explains that it does so because this is how these puzzles typically work and because it doesn't really make much sense without it. It then gets the answer right. This is something that would confuse many people as well."
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"Yes, but photorealistic paintings also look like pictures, yet they are actually paintings. The output looks human-like because it was trained on human data. You can also tell the model to only output machine readable data and then it will look less human-like..

A smart human would make a comment about what is missing to the puzzle. Claude actually did that at least for the game-show puzzle and explained in detail what information is missing and why it is important to the problem and then explains what the (correct) result for the question is and compared it to the result of the classical problem. 

Just assuming seemingly hidden information might make sense for this specific example, because some technological unskilled user seemingly didn't get the input right, but this is actually really problematic for all kinds of real world tasks, like just assuming non-existent contexts for programming tasks."
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"If it's Magnus, he would immediately tell you what year month day he saw the position and the page number of the book, dude has a superhuman memory when it comes to chess, remembers in details games that he saw like 2 decades ago"
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"Right, but the point is that to make a mistake like this is actually quite human like."
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"Haha fair enough! It does sound like a task that gets increasingly hard as the game progresses.. but yeah, most humans would at least remember the move set, I suppose."
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"I don't get what the point of this statement is.. If you dismiss any mistakes, errors and unwanted behaviour as ""well, kinda like a human, so it's good enuf"", then we don't get anywhere.

We *don't* want these systems to behave like humans, because it means it will copy all the biases and be prone to stupid mistakes. We want systems to be as reliable as possible and not a mediocre copycat of seemingly human behaviour."
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"Sure, I get that reasoning, but at the same time, if they were able to think like humans (which right now they can't) that would be a huge breakthrough. I've been playing with this quite a bit now with Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking and a bit with Deepseak R1 and it's interesting how much the models stick to the 2 people crossing at the same time constraint even if you tell them to only consider any explicit constraints and that the puzzle may in fact be trivial and different from the standard version. Interestingly, the part about the bridge being old and rickety doesn't seem to play a role here. 

It does sometimes pick up on this and if you are more explicit about the instructions it has no issues. Giving the answer back to the model and telling it that the answer is wrong because of some assumption being wrong also makes it correct the issue. 

So to me it's still quite impressive, although it does clearly show a weakness and limitations of these models."
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"Don't get me wrong, the current state of LLMs really is impressive. To me, the fact that these systems are ""just stochastical parrots"" *and* work as good as they already do is even more impressive.

We will never get a system that thinks like a human though, and we shouldn't strive to achieve that. We need a machine that is as good at problem solving and several other tasks, while getting rid of all negative human properties. Just imagine a LLM getting really afraid by an input prompt, or a panicking android roboter :D

We need systems that *understand* humans, not systems that *are like* humans."
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"Maybe, but still the fact that the mistake is make is actually very much a human like mistake is pretty cool and to me doesn't suggest that the models are just parrots."
[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"Except these mistakes aren't really human like, it just seems like it for a subset of mistakes. But I see that its difficult to grasp without math and compsci background."
[R] On the Reasoning Capacity of AI Models and How to Quantify It,"Isn't human reasoning also ""sophisticated combinations of memorization and pattern matching""?"
[R] On the Reasoning Capacity of AI Models and How to Quantify It,human reasoning can can adapt to new information. LLM models are static. Change my mind.
[R] On the Reasoning Capacity of AI Models and How to Quantify It,"Here’s a recipe.

Train an LLM on some dataset.

Fine tune it to do reasoning.

Use it to solve tasks that require reasoning and adapting to new information, where the correctness of the answer can be verified/judged.

Select outputs that are verified to be correct (or judged by humans to be better than other alternatives).

Add those to the training dataset.

Start again."
