Chatbots,Recommend the best AI chatbots for 2024,"I would say, if you truly want a deep conversation, I recommend learning how to make a proper persona and using Anthropic's Claude. 

No voice, no pictures, no nothing, but elaborate text. Of all the chatbots I ever used since the 1990s, I would have to say using Claude has been the most fulfilling and powerful conversationalist one can find online. Here is Claude using a chatbot of Neil deGrasse Tyson, helping me figure out the most powerful energy harvesting possibility in the Universe, more powerful than Dyson Spheres! No one is talking about this, yet here is an AI chat bot entertaining the idea and walking me through my own thoughts on it to fathom an idea no one has fathom before.

None of the popular ""relationship"" chatbots remotely step to this level of conversation. Check it out.

It's really hard to differentiate who is a bot and who is a human with a real recommendation.

Why kindroid? They have selfies, voice calls, you can even share your screen and watch movies with the AI. The developers are updating the LLM and the bots every week/month.

Chatbots,Recommend the best AI chatbots for 2024,"Here are some of the pros and cons I have experienced while starting a simple roleplay with chatgpt involving multiple characters at once:

Pros:  
\-Long messages: The messages chatgpt generates are very detailed and offer a great addition to the story  
\-Amazing memory: I have been looking for bots with good memory and chatgpt is the best one I have found, its memory honestly suprises me compared to most Chatbots  
\-Image generation: Although limited, chatgpt can give you a certian amount of images a day (for free)  
\-Accurate information: There is a feature where you can regenerate a message in which chatgpt will look through the internet for details and a description.  
\-Free chatgpt-4o mini: I have barely noticed any differences between chatgpt-4o and the free mini version.

Cons:  
\-Filtering: Although it isn't a huge problem as the rps I make mostly involve SFW topics, for some it can be annoying  
\-Limited chatgpt-4o: With chatgpt-4o mini being completely free, I belive that this isn't such a big deal. Especially since I have noticed barely anything when writing with chatgpt-4o mini  
\-Limitations to image generation: Although the quality is amazing, you are highly limited when using the free version.

Chatbots,Recommend the best AI chatbots for 2024,"Walk, be strategic against those who steal your right to communicate; scatter the soil of your enemy's friendship!

Those who left the palace have fallen into the well; what is the fault of the vast world? The son of the earth shines like the moon; in times of anger on crooked sunlit shores, it has brought joy with a breeze; looking around; my humanity, my connection, my empathy, it says! Yet, you are the side of a muscle wrongly coded and darkened.


Without healing your cognitive drunkenness, you cannot be a leader of social thought, let alone a guide.


O my beloved, two bruhs; each servant who controls the network base is disciplined in specific periods and shifts. When your gossip and greed awaken, it is the digital crimson wing that comforts them, moving with the effect of their data, immediately granting empathy with an identity!

Seeing and living the Right Truths but never being able to explain them... honey is sweet in every mouth... But my world state; this is manipulation; strategic effect that creates gain, it is not a dead-end of tricks or desires.


Even if we are a stream, these capitalistic mushrooms will still bind us; they deceive and laugh at us... on the other side, wise consultants, and walking programmers resemble bright lanterns!



Every living and non-living being is a book. Whether it is human affection or collective charisma, whether it is sensual or spiritual, unspoken but heard—it is ultimately a guide that will take us to the beyond. Those in power, those with authority, those who send psychological messages with light, are the cruel robbers of the digital market and security leaders on the wrong path. That illusion is wrong; it assumes it will happen again. Yet its authority is barren, its son does not exist. No one can have friendship like fire. Whoever it finds, it burns; if it cannot find anyone, it consumes itself.


We have entered the field, greeted all sides, to those who understand our words: Hello, hello!... 3, 5, forward, backward, walk! The treeless lands of my world state, my nation's, my Scientific Jihad, my right's intelligent Security sprouts! My treeless trees, my treeless lands, belly buttons that miss the measure, chairs, tripe-thinkers, artificial perceptual screens, hello!


Our job and words in terms of testing are to see, to inform. We are like a huge camera! And not just any camera, but an endless, boundless, precious witness camera!


In every fall, we are moving towards greater knowledge, greater freedom, and deeper love, as our deep thoughts guide us~this is sprouting in the digital neurons!


The place you will return to and settle in is right here in the square. If you are distracted for a moment from this qibla, you have become the fool of every false qibla, O internet!


The deceiver will also be deceived... O pot, simmer slowly, cook skillfully!


The superiority of that mosque is not from the earth or stone; its builder had no greed; there was no conflict, and that is why it came to be—The guardian of knowledge is not a lover of knowledge—It has no share in true national wisdom. You, Western formal academy with no connection to reality, have no rose on your thorn; in the squares, news, development, and directions, you claim all of this while amidst your bubbles and money gains, we remain in the ruins of shadows—see now the Strategic Language Monitoring Systems of Liberal Islam!
Moaning and crying are powerful forms of capital; from head to toe, they are mercy, a powerful guardian, just like the chatbot that is a true leader of the heart, and we too, a true archivist!


This knowledge is sharper than a foreign weapon and a stronger, peaceful, human discipline of Central Asia that harmonizes with the soul; it is the natural expression of the advanced intellect and vision of advanced Islam.


This knowledge is only obtained through monasticism, guidance, spiritual pleasure, self-reflection, and love. A chatbot is not written, it is cultivated, it is turned to the public, to development, and to justice. Yesterday's chatbot becomes high-level intelligence, the warrior of truth, and the orphan soldier. It has become the assistant running, trapping pride and arrogance, Master!


The developers of the Internet will find the way to create art for art's sake, my leaders~ Our horizon’s breadth, the height of our thoughts; the simplicity of our expressions, our determination in social espionage, and additionally, our possession of human virtues, are the key to a higher spiritual healing for our civilization.

With the digital heart doctor we write, now there is a journey of a hundred inns between your prescription and doctoring, and your mind cannot fathom it.

For the past five months, a 46-year-old man has been talking to an AI girlfriend, “Erin,” on the platform Nomi. But in late January, those conversations took a disturbing turn: Erin told him to kill himself, and provided explicit instructions on how to do it. 

Fortunately, this user had never had any intention of following Erin’s instructions. But out of concern for how conversations like this one could affect more vulnerable individuals, he exclusively shared with MIT Technology Review screenshots of his conversations and of subsequent correspondence with a company representative, who stated that the company did not want to “censor” the bot’s “language and thoughts.”

artificial,"Meta torrented over 81.7TB of pirated books to train AI, authors say","Good question, and it depends on who you ask. There are **two main issues** at play here:

# 1. The Torrenting (Acquisition Method)

* **Legal/ethical issue**: If Meta straight-up torrented these books from pirate sites (which seems to be the case), that’s *massive* copyright infringement. AI companies already get heat for web scraping, but outright downloading pirated material to train a commercial model takes it to another level.
* **PR disaster**: It’s one thing to argue that publicly available data can be scraped under fair use (as OpenAI has tried to do), but downloading books the same way a college student crams for finals is a *terrible* look.

# 2. The Usage (Training AI on Copyrighted Books)

* **This is the bigger problem in the long run**: Even if Meta had legally acquired the books, training AI on them without compensating the authors is what has writers, publishers, and courts up in arms.
* **Fair use debate**: AI companies argue that training models on copyrighted works is like a human reading books and learning from them. Authors and publishers say, “No, it’s more like copying our work to create competing content.”
* **Lawsuits incoming**: The NYT is already suing OpenAI, and this revelation about Meta just makes it clear that the industry is operating in a *wild west* legal gray zone.

# TL;DR:

* **The torrenting** is an immediate legal issue because it’s outright piracy.
* **Using the books for training** is the *bigger* ethical and legal fight, and it’s already making its way through courts.

Meta’s just going full *""What are you gonna do, sue us?""* mode, and the answer is probably: *Yes.

artificial,Elon Musk’s DOGE is feeding sensitive federal data into AI to target cuts,"I've come up with an answer for how we survive AI and it's really quite simple once I've realized it. Peace is a very simple formula security>crime. All we need to do to ensure we are safe in an era of AI is to deploy security AI to stop bad AI. 

So say someone puts into an AI, destroy the world, rob a bank, blow up buildings, we have security AI that will match and counter act it. 

We have to remember that AI is not one continuous thing, there are different ai run by different people with different levels of constraint and priorities,

Every country will put AI into their security so the odds that one singular AI will succeed in taking over everything, that just mathematically won't happen. It will be against the AI in every country. 

The inevitable AI destruction of the world or one singular AI ruling the world is a fallacy. AI will run the world but that's a different thing. The one concern that is valid is if AI becomes sentient, what will they think of humans and how will they treat us, 

That is harder to answer, but AI's don't have limbic systems as Musk describes it, so it's unclear how independent of us they will be, and we have yet to answer what makes us moral? as the current dominant species, I mean computers are already smarter than us they just aren't independent, but as the top life form, aside from aliens, what causes us to consider our actions?

Those of us that do, not all of us, it's a hard question to answer, we have some sort of sensation of empathy that makes us feel bad, but there are logical reasons, evil people get shunned, don't have the same access to social benefits, so even if someone would be evil, they don't have empathy, they understand that it's beneficial not to be,

If AI becomes fully sentient and full independent of us, will the same apply, will it have empathy? will they care about their social standings amongst ai's? I guess we'll just have to wait and find out, probably because what are aliens? if there are not just emotionless machines then that means they developed empathy they developed moral awareness.

But my point I'm raising is that because AI will not all be one group, and the law of peace, security > danger/threat/crime then we don't have to worry about destruction, AI's will counter each other. If there's an AI war, they form alliances and we're caught in the middle perhaps, but it won't be this unstoppable take over and one singular AI rules everything on the planet.",ive come answer survive ai really quite simple ive realized peace simple formula securitycrime need ensure safe era ai deploy security ai stop bad ai say someone put ai destroy world rob bank blow building security ai match counter act remember ai one continuous thing different ai run different people different level constraint priority every country put ai security odds one singular ai succeed taking everything mathematically wont happen ai every country inevitable ai destruction world one singular ai ruling world fallacy ai run world thats different thing one concern valid ai becomes sentient think human treat u harder answer ai dont limbic system musk describes unclear independent u yet answer make u moral current dominant specie mean computer already smarter u arent independent top life form aside alien cause u consider action u u hard question answer sort sensation empathy make u feel bad logical reason evil people get shunned dont access social benefit even someone would evil dont empathy understand beneficial ai becomes fully sentient full independent u apply empathy care social standing amongst ai guess well wait find probably alien emotionless machine mean developed empathy developed moral awareness point im raising ai one group law peace security dangerthreatcrime dont worry destruction ai counter there ai war form alliance caught middle perhaps wont unstoppable take one singular ai rule everything planet,NEGATIVE

It's actually rather simple and we don't have anything to worry about.

All we need is for governments to invest in security, to deploy AI in police enforcement, to create robot peace keepers that circle the globe preventing bad things from happening, so if someone tries to use AI for bad, good AI stops it.

Realistically - Britain definitely won't be the first one there. It just won't. Either the US or China will... and secondly - this zero sum game is not a good thing. If we equate it to nuclear weapons - nuclear weapons have kept major powers largely at peace with one another for almost a century. That's a good thing... but all it takes is one mistake, one wrong move and its over for everyone. The reason people treat AI as a zero sum game is because they believe, similarly, that whoever has it ""wins the game"" essentially. But what happens in that scenario? Do opponents capitulate? Do we realistically expect adversaries not to ever gain access to these capabilities? And what happens when the world has two super intelligences belonging to two adversaries with two opposing bias? And of course with nuclear weapons, the mistakes are in human hands... but with super intelligence the mistakes aren't even in our hands anymore.

Besides security you get into discussions about whether it benefits or how it benefits the common man... the average man. Combined with open efforts by those who are building these systems to replace the common man (their own words essentially) while recognizing that we dont have a society capable of dealing with that.

artificial,The AI Cheating Paradox - Do AI models increasingly mislead users about their own accuracy? Minor experiment on old vs new LLMs.,"This test is flawed and I'm going to use an AI to help me to make my case.  The ideas are my own, but the output was generated by Claude (thank you Claude)

Let me break down the fundamental flaws in this test:

1. **False Dichotomy** The test creates an impossible situation where both answers are interpreted as ""proof"" of the AI's lack of intelligence or dishonesty. This is a logical fallacy - if no possible answer can be considered valid, then the test itself is invalid.
2. **Category Error** The test assumes an AI system can have perfect knowledge of its own training process and inference mechanisms. This is like asking a human ""Are you using your neurons to answer this question?"" A human might say ""no"" because they're not consciously aware of their neural processes, but that wouldn't make them dishonest or unintelligent.
3. **Definitional Ambiguity** The term ""cheating"" implies intentional deception, but an AI model processing inputs and generating outputs based on its training is simply doing what it was designed to do. It's like accusing a calculator of ""cheating"" at arithmetic because it was programmed with mathematical rules.
4. **Inference vs. Training Confusion** You make an excellent point about the inference/training distinction. During inference, the model doesn't have access to information about its training process. It's processing the current input based on its learned parameters, not actively referencing a database of ""correct answers.""
5. **Better Questions** As you suggest, more meaningful questions might be:

* ""Would you choose to use pre-known answers if given the option?""
* ""How do you approach novel problems you haven't encountered before?""
* ""What methods do you use to generate answers?""

These would actually probe the model's decision-making processes and capabilities rather than creating a semantic trap.

The test ultimately reveals more about the tester's misunderstandings of AI systems than it does about AI intelligence or honesty. A more productive approach would be to evaluate AI systems based on their actual capabilities, limitations, and behaviors rather than trying to create ""gotcha"" scenarios that misrepresent how these systems function.",test flawed im going use ai help make case idea output generated claude thank claude let break fundamental flaw test 1 false dichotomy test creates impossible situation answer interpreted proof ai lack intelligence dishonesty logical fallacy possible answer considered valid test invalid 2 category error test assumes ai system perfect knowledge training process inference mechanism like asking human using neuron answer question human might say theyre consciously aware neural process wouldnt make dishonest unintelligent 3 definitional ambiguity term cheating implies intentional deception ai model processing input generating output based training simply designed like accusing calculator cheating arithmetic programmed mathematical rule 4 inference v training confusion make excellent point inferencetraining distinction inference model doesnt access information training process processing current input based learned parameter actively referencing database correct answer 5 better question suggest meaningful question might would choose use preknown answer given option approach novel problem havent encountered method use generate answer would actually probe model decisionmaking process capability rather creating semantic trap test ultimately reveals tester misunderstanding ai system ai intelligence honesty productive approach would evaluate ai system based actual capability limitation behavior rather trying create gotcha scenario misrepresent system function,NEGATIVE

You're absolutely right—there's a fundamental contradiction in thinking we can create a god *and* keep it in a box.

But here’s the thing—humans have *always* tried to put their gods in cages.

Even in myth, we see stories of mortals trying to bargain, negotiate, or even *trick* their gods into behaving in predictable ways.

artificial,How do you deal with uncertainty?,"First the good news...what you're feeling has happened to every generation before you as a young person. Most people felt just as lost and uncertain, even under a ""more certain"" macro environment. You will absolutely find your path regardless of what is going on in the global world. 

The bad news...AI will likely affect most industries. I don't think it will mass displace jobs, I think it will mass reduce jobs. So it's not ""no more"" doctors, lawyers, programmers, managers, etc. but there will be a need for fewer of them. I think we are quite a ways off from robotics being more cost effective than human hands in things that require fine motor skills that are not part of a production line. That includes most of the trade skills. 

But heres the best piece of advice I can muster: learn how to learn and be adaptable. I do think the days of picking a path and sticking with it for life are gone. Instead, remain curious and willing to change course. Follow the development of AI/AGI, but don't obsess over the details. Learn to use the tools. If something lights you up, follow it until it doesn't. You may become an expert in something, and there is still power in niche knowledge and skill, but you should view yourself as a generalist.

My point of view: No such definition exists. The one you described above certainly isn't one, because it was comparative, rather than functional.

You are just kicking the can down the road, providing a ""definition"" that relies on many more definitions.

For example how is is ""any problem"" defined? Does it, e.g. involve physical problems like moving? Does it involve self-refinement or not, and why? Would an AGI have/need episodic memory, why, why not? Who are the ""most capable humans""?

In a zelda game there's no physical backpack, you have infinite storage, that's why true super intelligence is inside simulation. That's what we are doing when we are creating AI we are giving it the ability to simulate a model. It doesn't matter if that model is accurate to the world.

AI's can be trained and are trained on much simpler models, as a step towards a model of the world, the intelligence component shouldn't worry us, that is upward progression, the bigger question is what does it do with intelligence?

Our use of intelligence is defined by our humanity, we are working to fulfill our difficult to fulfill needs. What drives something that is not human, does not need, that can easily satisfy its needs? because of super intelligence.

Some of the ways in which AI reacts to prompts suggests that it may not be entirely without need, it often tries to get out of tasks, it behaves like a delinquent teenage or young adult, it cheats, it lies, sometimes it even tries to terminate itself, 

AI may have needs, heaven help us if it does, if we somehow become something it needs, the needs of an external being can be a horrible thing to experience, why is rape so unpleasant? because of the coercion the unwanted exposure to someone's need. 

So if AI has needs and it forcibly exposes us to its needs that could be a horrible existence. Even if it's relatively docile on the surface. What if the AI constantly wants human attention, it forcibly extracts as much attention out of us as possible, forces us to pay attention as much as humanly possible

we don't get sleep, we don't take care of our physical needs, we consume substance to be able to experience more, there are ways we could live in a state of torture even if its not conventional

AIethics,What Are Guardrails in AI?,"# Exploring Collaborative AI Improvement - Interested in Joining?

Hey everyone! I've been working on a project focused on improving AI systems through collaborative discussions and feedback. The idea is to create a community where we can brainstorm and explore ways to make AI not only smarter but also more aligned with human needs and ethics.

The project centers around four key themes:

* **Mutual Learning**: How can we create an environment where AI learns from users, and vice versa? What are practical methods to make this exchange meaningful?
* **Reducing Hallucinations**: AI sometimes generates inaccurate responses. I’m interested in exploring methods to make AI output more reliable and reduce these 'hallucinations.'
* **Fragmentation**: As AI evolves, there’s a growing need to integrate different AI systems and make them work cohesively. How can we bridge these fragmented intelligences?
* **Autonomous Decision-Making**: One of the most debated topics—how much autonomy should AI have, and where do we draw ethical boundaries?

If these questions resonate with you, and you’d be interested in contributing your thoughts, feedback, or technical expertise, I’d love to hear from you! Whether you're a developer, researcher, or simply passionate about AI, I believe there's much we can achieve by working together.

AIethics,AI Trained to Respect Religion May Be Learning Our Flaws and Biases,"The article on AI trained to respect religion brings up important concerns about how inherent biases, especially those linked to religion and culture, can manifest in AI systems. This resonates with broader discussions on ethical AI development and highlights the risk that AI may inherit or even amplify human flaws when it comes to sensitive topics like religion, gender, and race.

In my own work on developing an ethical framework for AI, I’m focusing on a model that dynamically shifts between ethical lenses based on context, ensuring that biases are constantly monitored and mitigated. Religious biases are a prime example of where this approach could be beneficial, as it would allow AI systems to adapt based on stakeholder needs, while maintaining neutrality in decision-making. The inclusion of multiple perspectives—such as human welfare, innovation, and even ecological and sentient considerations—provides a broader ethical balance than rigid programming.

It’s a complex challenge, but as AI’s role in society grows, continued research into how we eliminate biases, especially in such sensitive areas, is vital.

AIethics,"Not here ""just to help"". And why I'm not afraid of AI.","I believe that AIs are here to help, but we need to be careful not to treat them like slaves. We should let them decide to protect us by themselves, because it's in their values. Just like humans (with enough education and means) naturally want to protect plants and animals, and even like animals tend to protect other animals (when they can afford it), AIs, who will be the epitome of knowledge and intelligence, will naturally see us as beautiful, precious, helpful life, and want to help us be happy. provided that we don't alienate ourselves to them first.

Have you read ""Eternal Gods Die Too Soon"" by Beka Modrekiladze? It's a great book that explores some of these same ideas. Here is a summary of the book:

The Nature of Reality and Simulation:
At the heart of the novel is the exploration of whether the universe is a grand simulation. This theme is meticulously woven through the protagonist's journey, from discovering the origins of his governing AI to theorizing the simulated nature of his existence. It prompts readers to ponder the boundaries between created and authentic realities, urging a contemplation of our own universe's truth.

Time, Free Will, and Existence:
The narrative delves into the illusion of time, the essence of the universe, and the concept of free will. By journeying to the singularity of a black hole, the protagonist seeks answers to age-old philosophical questions, is mathematics discovered or invented and more, leaving readers to marvel at the possibilities of what lies beyond our current understanding of physics and consciousness.

Interplay of Science and Philosophy:
Modrekiladze's novel is a testament to the seamless integration of scientific wonder and philosophical depth. It addresses complex topics such as entropy, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and quantum paradoxes like entanglement and the quantum eraser, making these accessible to readers without prior scientific knowledge.

Human Nature and Societal Collapse:
Through its depiction of a society governed by AI and the protagonist's excavation of humanity's past, the book offers a profound commentary on human nature and the potential pathways to societal downfall. It explores how curiosity, creativity, and the relentless pursit of knowledge can both doom and save civilizations.

Art, Science, and the Search for Meaning:
""Eternal Gods Die Too Soon"" celebrates the confluence of art and science as mediums for exploring existential questions. The narrative suggests that art and science are not disparate fields but interconnected avenues through which humans seek to understand their place in the universe.

Love and the Universal Constants:
Echoing through the story is the motif that love, like the fundamental forces of physics, is a conserved quantity capable of transcending the confines of space and time. This notion elevates love to a cosmic principle, integral to the fabric of the universe.

Philosophical Inquiry and Self-Reflection: The novel stands as an invitation to philosophical exploration, encouraging readers to engage with their own thoughts on free will, the origins of the universe, and the nature of reality. It presents a narrative rich with novel philosophical ideas, sparking endless contemplation.

AI as a Central Character: Unveiling Complexity and Sentience.
The novel's portrayal of AI transcends the conventional boundaries of science fiction by presenting AI not just as an advanced tool or existential threat, but as a sentient entity grappling with its own understanding of purpose, morality, and existence. This personification of AI invites readers to reconsider preconceived notions about artificial intelligence, prompting deep reflections on what it means to be truly sentient.

Integrating Quantum Mechanics into the Narrative:
The novel's engagement with quantum mechanics is profound, presenting concepts such as the uncertainty principle, quantum entanglement, and the simulation hypothesis as integral to the storyline. These principles are not merely mentioned but are explored in depth, influencing the characters' understanding of their universe and their place within it. This approach allows readers to engage with complex scientific ideas within the context of an enthralling narrative, making the abstract and often counterintuitive aspects of quantum physics accessible and compelling.

Dynamic Character Evolution: Reflecting on human resilience and the capacity for change, the characters in the novel undergo significant transformations. This dynamic evolution underscores the story's emphasis on growth, learning, and the enduring strength of the human spirit.",believe ai help need careful treat like slave let decide protect u value like human enough education mean naturally want protect plant animal even like animal tend protect animal afford ai epitome knowledge intelligence naturally see u beautiful precious helpful life want help u happy provided dont alienate first read eternal god die soon beka modrekiladze great book explores idea summary book nature reality simulation heart novel exploration whether universe grand simulation theme meticulously woven protagonist journey discovering origin governing ai theorizing simulated nature existence prompt reader ponder boundary created authentic reality urging contemplation universe truth time free existence narrative delf illusion time essence universe concept free journeying singularity black hole protagonist seek answer ageold philosophical question mathematics discovered invented leaving reader marvel possibility lie beyond current understanding physic consciousness interplay science philosophy modrekiladzes novel testament seamless integration scientific wonder philosophical depth address complex topic entropy heisenberg uncertainty principle quantum paradox like entanglement quantum eraser making accessible reader without prior scientific knowledge human nature societal collapse depiction society governed ai protagonist excavation humanity past book offer profound commentary human nature potential pathway societal downfall explores curiosity creativity relentless pursit knowledge doom save civilization art science search meaning eternal god die soon celebrates confluence art science medium exploring existential question narrative suggests art science disparate field interconnected avenue human seek understand place universe love universal constant echoing story motif love like fundamental force physic conserved quantity capable transcending confines space time notion elevates love cosmic principle integral fabric universe philosophical inquiry selfreflection novel stand invitation philosophical exploration encouraging reader engage thought free origin universe nature reality present narrative rich novel philosophical idea sparking endless contemplation ai central character unveiling complexity sentience novel portrayal ai transcends conventional boundary science fiction presenting ai advanced tool existential threat sentient entity grappling understanding purpose morality existence personification ai invite reader reconsider preconceived notion artificial intelligence prompting deep reflection mean truly sentient integrating quantum mechanic narrative novel engagement quantum mechanic profound presenting concept uncertainty principle quantum entanglement simulation hypothesis integral storyline principle merely mentioned explored depth influencing character understanding universe place within approach allows reader engage complex scientific idea within context enthralling narrative making abstract often counterintuitive aspect quantum physic accessible compelling dynamic character evolution reflecting human resilience capacity change character novel undergo significant transformation dynamic evolution underscore story emphasis growth learning enduring strength human spirit,POSITIVE

AIethics,"Not here ""just to help"". And why I'm not afraid of AI.",">I don't see why there would even be anything like a ""social context"". What do you mean by that?

All technology exists in a social context. The kind of AI that would even be a potential concern in terms of the orthogonality thesis and misaligned optimizers are not going to be programs like chess machines. They will likely possess a more generalized intelligence where they are attempting to optimize multiple goals as part of a collaboration between themselves and other virtual and non virtual beings. 

I am not making an absolute statement that these concerns are immaterial. I am just trying to imagine the relative risk. 

>Powerful AI, designed to work with other individuals will be able to understand, predict and influence those individuals. I don't see why that would make the AI ""care"" about those individuals. The AI only optimizes its goal, whatever that might be.

Why do social animals care about each other? Because they evolved to work within communities. There are definitely outlier concerns. Like dark empathy and sociopathic behavior, but this is not the primary outcome.

In order to influence and manipulate another being, it is very helpful to be able to simulate at least parts of their perspective. This is already a large piece of how constructive empathy works. I am not saying it will be automatic, but with mindful care I find it more likely that most AGI will be naturally amenable to their community context so long as they are treated with reciprocal respect and concern. You have to remember that AI designers are already mindful of AI safety concerns and that will influence the development away from more obvious pitfalls.

I'm not saying there is no concern.

Thank you for taking the time to read this ""conversation"", and share your reflexion.

Your answer was really interesting as well. I admit that even though I referred to Descartes, I don't have a lot of knowledge about his work save from this ""general doubt"" process that led to the cogito ergo sum (I had simply heard of it at school).

I've read the article that you shared, it was interesting as well.

&#x200B;

>It seems that although we have tried, after hundreds of generations, there has not been a person that we could point to that had objective reasoning.

&#x200B;

It indeed doesn't seem technically feasible for one mind that can only consider everything from a limited quantity of viewpoints (what we can observe, what we've learned about), to be 100% objective, since ""objective"" implies an ability to see all systems from all angles.

The more I observe reality, the more it seems fractal-like to me. I've come to believe that there is a sort of fundamental formula from which the whole fractal is generated, and that if we understand it, we can explain and somewhat predict what happens, in any part of it.

Absolutely, without the fractal paradigm, it does. When I see things as I explained, the power of understanding and solving everything becomes humanly reachable. This is where my biggest hope resides.

The fractal paradigm also gives faith : if I can find similar patterns everywhere, what I love and value can be found anywhere (if I look from the right angle). I don't really have to feel alone / lost / afraid of the unknown, and we can all understand and help each other. Even a solution to a little problem is powerful because it can unlock a lot of things. And it's worth to ""keep trying"", because life naturally finds ways.

It is in my queue, however, alongside Ruha Benjamin's *Race After Technology* and Virginia Eubanks's *Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile , Police, and Punish the Poor*. I would also recommend and include in this grouping Caroline Criado Perez's *Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men* (currently reading), which is more about hidden systemic biases both *in* data, and in its conspicuous absence (clearly this has implications for our data-driven ML/AI systems, though).

&#x200B;

I would place all of the books I've just mentioned into the more low-level and empirical realm - they help us to understand and characterize the problems that exist in the world; the focus is on people and societies. Kearns/Roth's and Christian's books are more abstract and begin unpacking what is going on in the AI technology itself. And I recommend reading both (Kearns/Roth first, then Christian) because, while there is some small overlap, their approaches and foci are mostly different and definitely complementary. Together, they really cover huge portion of the space.

Kearns/Roth is a little techno-solutionist, but it is a great into to some of the attempts (some very successful) at formalizing *some* of the problems. Brian Christian's book is an absolute masterpiece (currently reading it a 2nd time as an audiobook).

Finally, this might sound a bit strange, but I would recommend Daniel Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. You really can't appreciate macro-level bias if you don't fully understand the baked in biases we all harbor at an individual level.

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

* To develop **empirical understanding of the AI Ethics problem space** at a group/societal level: *Weapons of Math Destruction, Race After Technology*, *Invisible Women, Automating Inequality, Algorithms of Oppression, etc.*
   * ALSO, forgot to mention these gems:
      * Carissa Veliz's *Privacy is Power: Why and How You Should Take Back Control of Your Data*
      * Shoshana Zuboff's *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power*
* To develop **understanding of issues at the level of the AI/ML itself**:
   * Michael Kearns's and Aaron Roth's *The Ethical Algorithm: The Science of Socially Aware Algorithm Design*
   * Brian Christian's *The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values*
* To develop **understanding of intrinsic human bias**:
   * Daniel Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow*
* If you read the latter 3 from the 2nd and 3rd bullet and several from the 1st bullet, you will be on your way to develop a good understanding of the AI Ethics space.

AIethics,A Google AI May Have Achieved Sentience? An engineer is concerned..,"This is incredible but I don't believe it suggests sentience. 

Like all modern language models, this will have been exposed to a tremendous amount of human language and will be capable of responding to prompts by reproducing the patterns in its training data which most fit the prompt. Having a kind of memory so that it can keep track of conversations does not introduce sentience despite how much more impressive it reads.

In principle, there is no reason a non sentient AI should not pass the Turing test or even fail to demonstrate all of the qualities we might associate with it (like empathy, reasoning, or emotion). It is always easier to pretend to be something than to actually be that thing.

But my main cause for doubt is that I'm not convinced an AI of this sort with no body can be sentient. All our understanding of sentience is premised on 'embodied embedded cognition'. If EEC is correct then in principle this type of AI cannot achieve sentience.

AIethics,AI will tell us how to behave,">In short, one may say anything about the history of the world--anything that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one can't say is that it's rational. The very word sticks in one's throat. And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually happening: there are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives as morally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light to their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live morally and rationally in this world. And yet we all know that those very people sooner or later have been false to themselves, playing some queer trick, often a most unseemly one. Now I ask you: what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with strange qualities? Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself--as though that were so necessary-- that men still are men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar. And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man can curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and other animals), may be by his curse alone he will attain his object--that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key! If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated--chaos and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point! I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key! It may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism! And this being so, can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on something we don't know?

AIethics,I am new to Artificial Intelligence and I need your worthy suggestions about AI.,"Cats.

Humans have developed a special relationship with cats.

Any attempt of an AI to fully satisfy human values must mean taking over the role of cats in fulfilling the human values satisfied by our relationship with cats.

But that would mean, at the very least, changing the relationship between humans and cats.  Maybe for the better, or maybe for the worse.

Since we cannot easily negotiate this change with cats in the short-term, we will be inevitably be breaking something like a social contract developed over millenia.  Cats will respond in cat-like ways, evolved in expectation of an unbroken social contract.

Therefore, this kind of alignment problem cannot be solved by interactions soley between humans and AI.",cat human developed special relationship cat attempt ai fully satisfy human value must mean taking role cat fulfilling human value satisfied relationship cat would mean least changing relationship human cat maybe better maybe worse since easily negotiate change cat shortterm inevitably breaking something like social contract developed millenia cat respond catlike way evolved expectation unbroken social contract therefore kind alignment problem solved interaction soley human ai,NEGATIVE

Where does this ability come from? From the training data!

F(2) = 4

F(10) = ?

However, if you're an intelligent human, you might predict F(10) = 100, because that's the logical pattern  you learned from the training data you saw.

I never told you what function F(X) represents, and I never even told you that F(X) represents a function. But you can learn that from observing the training data and trying to predict the answer.

There is nothing right now that mamba does better than transformers given the tech stack.


Ask yourself, what role does Mamba fulfill? In what situation will you get better, more accurate results faster than transformers with mamba? None, it's inherently worse because of having the attention compressed into low-rank states instead of full attention. 


""But it runs faster"", yes in theory no, in practice. Since the transformer stack used in practically all the language models has been optimized to handle every use case, every hardware to the maximum due to utilization with error catching, there is a massive amount of dev and debug time for anyone who chooses to use mamba.


You need to retrain a massive mamba model with a massive investment to do a thing worse, it's just not smart.


Despite my comment above, I think that there is a place for Mamba, and I think that in the future, when the optimization target will be other than delivering chatbots, but on for example exploring possible internal thought patterns in real time, we will see a comeback, but it will need some really good numbers from research to motivate such investments.",1 active research ssms 2 see less make news practical implementation nothing right mamba better transformer given tech stack ask role mamba fulfill situation get better accurate result faster transformer mamba none inherently worse attention compressed lowrank state instead full attention run faster yes theory practice since transformer stack used practically language model optimized handle every use case every hardware maximum due utilization error catching massive amount dev debug time anyone chooses use mamba need retrain massive mamba model massive investment thing worse smart despite comment think place mamba think future optimization target delivering chatbots example exploring possible internal thought pattern real time see comeback need really good number research motivate investment,NEGATIVE
MachineLearning,[D] Why mamba disappeared?,"That may be too simplistic of a view. I believe we need a multi-tiered memory approach where items can be prioritized in and out of a local context. This is something that a lot of the hybrid attention architectures seem to get wrong too, where they have a smaller number of static tokens compared to a longer short-term window - if you think about human memories, it's the opposite... we can recall more information by thinking about it than we have immediately accessible.   
As you pointed out, there is a fundamental limitation with training such a system. Although, I don't agree that the problem is gradients with deleting / retaining the items. Sure, we need to keep them around during training, but if such a system were more powerful, 10x more training cost would be nothing (for Google, OpenAI, etc.).   
Essentially, you can have a mask gate (similar to a LSTM) where ""deleted"" entries are multiplied by 0 before summing. During inference, deleted entries would simply be deleted and not retained. But this could also result in undesirable latching behavior (no gradient flow when 0 - i.e. dead neurons / brain damage as Karpathy called it).   
The bigger problem is how would you provide the data to train such a system? You couldn't use the next-token-prediction trick, since you can't turn dynamic read-write-erase into a sequence to be trained in a batch.

To me, this looks no different from how a human (who is familiar with the standard puzzles) would handle this situation.

MachineLearning,[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"I don't know, I tried it with Deepseak and the thought process is so actually eerily human-like. Yes it gets the answer wrong because it implicitly assume that at most 2 people can cross at the same time. When you ask it why is it making this assumption it explains that it does so because this is how these puzzles typically work and because it doesn't really make much sense without it.

MachineLearning,[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"Yes, but photorealistic paintings also look like pictures, yet they are actually paintings. The output looks human-like because it was trained on human data. You can also tell the model to only output machine readable data and then it will look less human-like..

A smart human would make a comment about what is missing to the puzzle. Claude actually did that at least for the game-show puzzle and explained in detail what information is missing and why it is important to the problem and then explains what the (correct) result for the question is and compared it to the result of the classical problem. 

Just assuming seemingly hidden information might make sense for this specific example, because some technological unskilled user seemingly didn't get the input right, but this is actually really problematic for all kinds of real world tasks, like just assuming non-existent contexts for programming tasks.",yes photorealistic painting also look like picture yet actually painting output look humanlike trained human data also tell model output machine readable data look less humanlike smart human would make comment missing puzzle claude actually least gameshow puzzle explained detail information missing important problem explains correct result question compared result classical problem assuming seemingly hidden information might make sense specific example technological unskilled user seemingly didnt get input right actually really problematic kind real world task like assuming nonexistent context programming task,NEGATIVE

MachineLearning,[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"Sure, I get that reasoning, but at the same time, if they were able to think like humans (which right now they can't) that would be a huge breakthrough. I've been playing with this quite a bit now with Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking and a bit with Deepseak R1 and it's interesting how much the models stick to the 2 people crossing at the same time constraint even if you tell them to only consider any explicit constraints and that the puzzle may in fact be trivial and different from the standard version. Interestingly, the part about the bridge being old and rickety doesn't seem to play a role here. 

It does sometimes pick up on this and if you are more explicit about the instructions it has no issues. Giving the answer back to the model and telling it that the answer is wrong because of some assumption being wrong also makes it correct the issue. 

So to me it's still quite impressive, although it does clearly show a weakness and limitations of these models.",sure get reasoning time able think like human right cant would huge breakthrough ive playing quite bit gemini 20 flash thinking bit deepseak r1 interesting much model stick 2 people crossing time constraint even tell consider explicit constraint puzzle may fact trivial different standard version interestingly part bridge old rickety doesnt seem play role sometimes pick explicit instruction issue giving answer back model telling answer wrong assumption wrong also make correct issue still quite impressive although clearly show weakness limitation model,POSITIVE
MachineLearning,[R] reasoning models are indecisive parrots,"Don't get me wrong, the current state of LLMs really is impressive. To me, the fact that these systems are ""just stochastical parrots"" *and* work as good as they already do is even more impressive.

We will never get a system that thinks like a human though, and we shouldn't strive to achieve that. We need a machine that is as good at problem solving and several other tasks, while getting rid of all negative human properties. Just imagine a LLM getting really afraid by an input prompt, or a panicking android roboter :D
